        <p>I needed a project under my semester and this was one that I felt was going to make me happy since I´m into game programming, and 
            I really wanted to make something for my kids.
        </p>
        <p>There are 2 mingames in here, "Which one should be removed?"(Dont know the english equivalent for it namewise) and "Name the animal". </p>
        <p>The game is not at the Google play store and will probably stay that way. If anyone feel like they want to see the gameplay and simplicity of the 
            game you are more than welcome to contact me. It is not my proudest production, but it is something.
