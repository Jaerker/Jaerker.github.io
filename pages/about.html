        <p>
            I grew up in a small town in Värmland, Sweden, called Sunne, with 4 siblings. I´ve been a bit crazy over computers ever since I 
            completely locked down our first PC when I was trying to be a hot shot hacker. A few years after that, I got the opportunity to learn 
            a bit of coding in C++ by a good friend of mine and got hooked.
        </p>
        <p>
            Due to personal reasons, I have never been able to go to do any longer studies on programming, although some smaller ones in C#. 
            Hopefully I can show off my skills more over on this CV, or at least show that if I get the time and trust, I would be a valuable asset 
            for a company.
