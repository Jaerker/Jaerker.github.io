        <p>This is a work in progress, but feel free to snoop around to see if some new features have shown up. This is a CV built with my sparetime as father and almost fulltime worker.</p>
        <p>My short personal message here for now will be that I'm looking forward to work with programming in a near future. Im sorry that I'm not able to show to much 
            of my work yet, but it is in progress and I hope that if the person that is reading this is looking for an almost programmer with potential will give me a shot.
        </p>
        <p>Just as a side note: Please check my git hub repos, some are a bit empty but it shows a bit of what I like to work with and my passion which is C#, Xamarin, Python and what people find interesting and can make my mind wander away and learn it, like Javascript for the moment being!</p>
